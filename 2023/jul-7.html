                <h2>Back From Outreach!</h2>
                <p>Hello! I just made it back home from the outreach last Wednesday. I had been unable to send another updated during the majority of the outreach because of the nature of the program. However, I am excited to present the video below that gives a look into what it was like.</p>

                <h2>What Happened?</h2>
                <p>The outreach was not only a trip, but an experience that grew me in so many ways, taught me to do things I had never done before, shown me the amazing provision of God. We were part of a new movement that is about to take place in the YWAM base in Trinidad. Our team was first in over 2 years that came as a confirmation to what is about to happen at that base. We connected with churches and schools throughout the country to lay the groundwork for what is going to happen with the base. We were also able to distribute bibles to about 1000 children in the schools. There are endless stories I wish I could all tell, but I hope to be able to share them all with you possibly in person while I am back here in the US.</p>
            <section>
                <h2>Thank you!</h2>
                <p>I want to thank you for the donations that made this possible and for your prayers. I will send out another update if I have plans to make another trip, but in the meantime I would appreciate prayers for wisdom and direction for what is next. Also please get in touch or stop by sometime while I am back here.</p>
