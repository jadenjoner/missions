                <h2>Off to Mexico City!</h2>
                <p>This Wednesday we are heading on outreach first to Mexico City! We ordered the tickets and the students without passports were able to make appointments in Mexico City which is an answer to prayer! I am also still in need of support for paying the rest
                of the outreach fees (which you can see below), as well as personal expenses, and I would appreciate it if you would
                join me in prayer for these needs. This next week will be the last lecture week and is going to be on spiritual warfare,
                a topic that I have been anticipating for a while and is essential for preparing our team for the outreach.</p>

                <h2>About the Outreach</h2>
                <p>For the first portion of the outreach in Mexico City, we will be staying at a local YWAM base and be assigned to help
                and serve the base in any way we can, as well as participate in evangelism and teachings in the local churches. I am
                still not sure what other ministries we will be able to serve in yet, however, I am very excited!</p>

                <p>The second part of the outreach will be spent for a month in Trinidad and Tobago where our main ministry is going to be
                passing out 1000 Bibles to local schools and encouraging the kids to read it. We will also participate in other
                activities such as teaching, evangelism, and maintaining run-down buildings at the base. The country is a mixing pot of
                many cultures and consists of two islands, Trinidad and Tobago. It is located at the cost of Venezuela. Both English and
                Creole are spoken there as it is a former English colony but is very ethnically diverse.</p>
