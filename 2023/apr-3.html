                <h2>Just Completed a Mini-Outreach Week</h2>
                <p>A week ago, the YWAM base hosted a church team of 40 as part of the DTS mini-outreach for a week. During the week, we painted a park, a church and repaired 2 roads, as well as participated in the local ministries. My job during the week was to record everything to make a video which you can see below.</p>

                <h2>We're Going On Outreach!</h2>
                <p>Some exciting news is that we decide on our location for the outreach and that is going to be Trinidad and Tobago! I am really excited because we have been praying since the beginning of the DTS to where we should go. I would love to share the story about how we choose to anyone who wants to hear more information on that and I will keep updating about the outreach. We are also starting to raise funds and start planning for the outreach, and I would appreciate prayers for this.</p>

                <p>This is the first official update I am sending out and I plan on sending out another soon. Please be praying for my time during the DTS as we prepare for outreach. Thank you so much for your support that makes it possible for me to be here to grow and serve!</p>

                <h2>Finances</h2>

                <p>Thanks to all the support I was able to pay the rest of the fees for the lecture phase of the DTS! While we have been recently planning for the outreach, I have been so encouraged by some of the donations that came in during that time that show me how God is going to provide!</p>
